Report / Thesis template for Aalto University made with Typst.

Follow insructions [here](https://github.com/typst/typst) to install Typst. Additionally for usage in VSCode install the [Tinymist Typst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) VSCode extension.

Use this template by cloning this repo and editing main.typ and lang.toml to your liking.

NOTE: Finnish Intro does not work properly yet. Hence some values which would be more sensible in lang.toml are given as arguments to #intro. If you wist to have a Finnish intro delete the en part from lang.toml.
